/*
List of absolute units in CSS:
px: This is the most common absolute unit for screen displays. While it's called "absolute," a CSS pixel doesn' t always map to a single physical screen pixel, especially on high-DPI (Retina) displays. It's a standardized unit for web rendering.
cm: A physical unit, typically 1cm=96px/2.54. Primarily used for print media stylesheets.
mm: A physical unit, 1mm=1/10th of a centimeter. Primarily used for print media stylesheets.
in: A physical unit, 1in=2.54cm=96px. Primarily used for print media stylesheets.
pt: A physical unit, 1pt=1/72 of an inch. Commonly used in typography, especially for print.
pc: A physical unit, 1pc=12 points. Also a typographical unit, mainly for print.

/*
List of relative units in CSS:
% : Relative to the parent element's corresponding property. For example, width: 50%; means 50% of the parent' s width.
em: Relative to the font-size of the element itself. If used for font-size, it's relative to the font-size of the parent element. This can lead to compounding effects in nested elements.
rem: Relative to the font-size of the root <html>element. This is often preferred over em for consistent scaling across an entire document, as it avoids the compounding issues of em.
vw: Relative to 1% of the viewport's width. So, 100vw is the full width of the browser window.
vh: Relative to 1% of the viewport's height. So, 100vh is the full height of the browser window.
vmin: Relative to 1% of the smaller dimension of the viewport (either width or height). For example, if the viewport is 800px wide and 600px tall, 1vmin would be 6px.
vmax : Relative to 1% of the larger dimension of the viewport (either width or height). For example, if the viewport is 800px wide and 600px tall, 1vmax would be 8px.
ch: Relative to the advance measure (width) of the "0"(zero) character of the element's current font. Often used for setting readable line lengths in text.
ex: Relative to the x-height of the current font (typically the height of the lowercase 'x'). Less commonly used than em or rem.
