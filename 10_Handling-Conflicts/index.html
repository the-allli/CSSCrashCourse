    <h2>
      The aim of this lesson is to develop your understanding of some of the
      most fundamental concepts of CSS — the cascade, specificity, and
      inheritance — which control how CSS is applied to HTML and how conflicts
      between style declarations are resolved.
    </h2>
    <div class="specificity">
      <h3>Cascade</h3>
      <p>
        At a very simple level, this means that the origin and the order of CSS
        rules matter. When two rules both have equal specificity, the one that
        is defined last in the stylesheet is the one that will be used.
      </p>
      <code>h5 { color: red; } h5 { color: blue; }</code>
      <h5>This is my heading.</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Specificity</h3>
      <p>
        Specificity is an algorithm that the browser uses to decide which
        property value is applied to an element. If multiple rules have
        different selectors that set different values for the same property and
        target the same element, specificity decides the property value that
        gets applied to the element. Specificity is basically a measure of how
        specific a selector's selection will be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An type (element) selector is less specific; it will select all
          elements of that type that appear on a page, so it has less weight.
          Pseudo-element selectors have the same specificity as regular element
          selectors.
        </li>
        <li>
          A class selector is more specific; it will select only the elements on
          a page that have a specific class attribute value, so it has more
          weight. Attribute selectors and pseudo-classes have the same weight as
          a class.
        </li>
        <li>
          An ID selector is even more specific — it only selects a single
          element with a specific id value. It therefore has even more weight.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code
        >#specificity { color: green; } .main-heading { color: red; } h5 {
        color: blue; }</code
      >
      <h5 class="main-heading" id="specificity">This is my heading.</h5>
    </div>
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Inheritance also needs to be understood in this context — some CSS
        property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child
        elements, and some aren't. For example, if you set a color and
        font-family on an element, every element inside it will also be styled
        with that color and font, unless you've applied different color and font
        values directly to them.
      </p>
      <code>.inheritance { color: blue; } span { color: black; }</code>
      <div class="inheritance">
        <h5>
          As the body has been set to have a color of blue this is inherited
          through the descendants. We can change the color by specifically
          targeting an element with a different style, such as this
          <span>span</span>.
        </h5>
      </div>
      <h4>Controlling inheritance</h4>
      <div>
        <dl>
          <dt>inherit</dt>
          <dd>
            Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same
            as that of its parent element. Effectively, this turns on
            inheritance.
          </dd>
          <dt>initial</dt>
          <dd>
            Sets the property value applied to a selected element to the initial
            value of that property.
          </dd>
          <dt>revert</dt>
          <dd>
            Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the
            browser's default styling rather than the defaults applied to that
            property. This value acts like unset in many cases.
          </dd>
          <dt>unset</dt>
          <dd>
            Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the
            property is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it
            acts like initial.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <code
        >.controlling-inheritance { color: green; } .my-class-1 a { color:
        inherit; } .my-class-2 a { color: initial; } .my-class-3 a { color:
        revert; } .my-class-4 a { color: unset; }</code
      >
      <div class="controlling-inheritance">
        <ul>
          <li>Default <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
          <li class="my-class-1">Inherit <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
          <li class="my-class-2">Initial <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
          <li class="my-class-3">Revert <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
          <li class="my-class-4">Unset <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="inline">
        <h4 style="color: brown">Inline styles</h4>
        <p style="color: black">
          Inline styles, that is, the style declaration inside a style
          attribute, take precedence over all normal styles, no matter the
          specificity. Such declarations don't have selectors, but their
          specificity can be construed as 1-0-0-0; always more than any other
          specificity weight no matter how many IDs are in the selectors
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>!important</h4>
        <p>
          There is a special piece of CSS that you can use to overrule all of
          the above calculations, even inline styles - the !important flag.
          However, you should be very careful when using it. This flag is used
          to make an individual property and value pair the most specific rule,
          thereby overriding the normal rules of the cascade, including normal
          inline styles.
        </p>
